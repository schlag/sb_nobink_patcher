# Description
This tool patches the Shadowbane binary to skip playing back Bink videos. This elimnates the blank videos that play on startup, shutdown, and during the 'death tunnel'. A bonus of this is that is also prevents the occasion hang/crash when Shadowbane exits and plays the blank video. Overall just a better experince starting and closing Shadowbane.
